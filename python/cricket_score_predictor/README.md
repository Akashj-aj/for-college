# Cricket Score Prediction Model

This project leverages machine learning to predict cricket scores based on historical data. It uses player stats and match details to predict outcomes such as individual runs scored and match results (win or lose).

## Project Overview

This model predicts cricket scores by analyzing historical performance and match conditions. Built with Python and Flask, it includes a simple API to make predictions and a UI for easy input of match data.

### Main Objectives
- Predict runs scored by players.
- Predict match results (win or lose) based on current conditions.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained on historical cricket data to make predictions.
- **Flask API**: Simple and RESTful API for serving predictions.
- **UI for Predictions**: Input player name, runs scored, wickets taken, and team information to get predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    If you are using GitHub Desktop do not copy "git clone" just copy-paste the URL
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/paperbukit/college-programs
    cd cricket-score-prediction
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Open cmd as admin and copy paste the following one-by-one
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    pip install scikit-learn
    pip install flask
    pip install joblib
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    - Start the Flask server:
      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```
    - The app should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

To use the prediction model:
1. Run the model.py
2. Run the app.py
3. Open the browser and paste the IP found in the terminal of your IDE
4. Enter the required inputs, such as Player Name, Current Runs, Wickets Taken, and Team.
3. Submit the form to view the predicted outcome.

### Example Request (API)

You can also access predictions via API using the provided `request.py` script:
```bash
python request.py
```

## Files and Structure

- `model.py`: Contains the machine learning model code and functions for loading and processing data.
- `app.py`: Sets up the Flask server to serve the API endpoints.
- `request.py`: Script for making API requests to test the model.

## Model Details

The model uses several features to predict outcomes, including:
- **Player statistics**: Historical performance metrics for each player.
- **Match conditions**: Current run count, wickets taken, etc.

### Data Fields
Key columns in the dataset:
- `Year`, `Player_Name`, `Matches_Batted`, `Not_Outs`, `Runs_Scored`, `Highest_Score`, `Batting_Average`, `Balls_Faced`, `Batting_Strike_Rate`, `Centuries`, `Half_Centuries`, `Fours`, `Sixes`, `Catches_Taken`, `Stumpings`, `Matches_Bowled`, `Balls_Bowled`, `Runs_Conceded`, `Wickets_Taken`, `Best_Bowling_Match`, `Bowling_Average`, `Economy_Rate`, `Bowling_Strike_Rate`, `Four_Wicket_Hauls`, `Five_Wicket_Hauls`.

## API Endpoints

- **`/predict`**: Accepts JSON data for player information and match conditions, and returns a prediction for runs scored and match outcome.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for live match data input.
- Enhance the model for more accurate predictions based on additional conditions.
- Improve UI with interactive features for data visualization.
